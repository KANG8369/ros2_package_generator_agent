ROS 2 package that provides configurable dummy sensor data for testing and development. The package should generate synthetic measurements for common sensors (e.g., IMU, range/laser, temperature, and placeholder image streams), transmit them through ROS 2 topics with adjustable rates, frames, and noise/offset models, and include launch/config options to reproduce scenarios and visualize the published data.
